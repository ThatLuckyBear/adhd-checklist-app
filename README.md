# adhd-checklist-app
I started this idea as a script empowered spreadsheet but I think it would be better as a standalone app. That said it has a long way to go and may never actually 'exist.'

# app goals
Elevator pitch goal: Checklist app that works within the needs of an ADHD mind without being punitive or rewarding. Just good old fashioned utility.

# problems vs solutions
Problem: Many checklist apps do not allow for recurring tasks within timespans ie: every week take out the garbage. 
Solution: Checklist updates itself daily adding tasks into the list when needed (ie: every time the trash needs to go out it is added to the list)

Problem: Many checklist apps that do allow for recurring tasks do not allow them to be at odd intervals or scheduled for specific days.
Solution: Checklist can refresh a task weekly on a day, X number of days, on X days a week, or other useful intervals.

Problem: Many checklist apps are a straightforward list of items that cannot be sorted or filtered to make them more useful
Solution: Tasks can be assigned attributes and be grouped, filtered, or sorted by those attributes (date last completed, days since last completion, freqency of task, priority of task)

Problem: Many checklist apps do not account for "missed" or "late" tasks and treat them the same as any other task in the list
Solution: Checklist keeps track of the last date a task was completed and increases it's priority if necessary to make it more obvious that it needs to be done.
